A Notion like experience for Linux

I've always enjoyed using Notion but wanted more customizability. The apis are OK but feel somewhat
limiting compared to what I could potentially do with Linux

Use case


1. Managing daily/weekly/monthly/yearly journals.
Everyday run an integration that generates a daily log journal.
These are auto generated documents on a timer, which are then stored in a table or database (some sort of storage).
Run another integration to archive these documents and put them in another storage container.

2. AI assistant functionality.
Ask AI (ChatGPT) questions and get responses. Save responses to different storage units. Allow
search and find.

3. Programming sandbox
Easily spin up playgrounds for various programming languages. Easy search for cookbook recipes.




Features
* create daily/weekly/monthly journal entries
* manage todo lists
* send alerts / reminders
* calendar functionality
* (maybe) connectors to Notion
* tables / connectors to DBs
* easy timer settings (chron jobs)
* restoration (when logging back in, restore what should be there)
